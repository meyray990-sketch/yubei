#  Hi, I'm Raymond Yubei

 Aspiring SOC Analyst with a strong interest in threat detection, log analysis,
and incident response. I am actively building hands-on experience through labs,
SIEM investigations, and security documentation.

I enjoy breaking down security alerts, understanding attacker behavior,
and documenting findings clearly—just like in a real SOC environment.
